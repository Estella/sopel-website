# Introduction

<span class="Willie">Willie</span> is a simple, lightweight, open source,
easy-to-use IRC utility bot, written in [Python](http://python.org). It's
designed to be easy to use, easy to run, and easy to make new features for.

<span class="Willie">Willie</span> comes with a ton of ready-made features for
you to use. It can leave notes for people, give you reminders, check RSS feeds,
and [much more](https://github.com/embolalia/willie/wiki/Commands).

<span class="Willie">Willie</span> also comes with a
[fully-documented](/docs) and
easy-to-use API, so you can write your own features. There's also an
[easy tutorial](https://github.com/embolalia/willie/wiki/Willie-tutorial,-Part-1)
you can follow along with, to help you learn.

Developing for Willie is a great way to familiarize yourself with Python. It's
easy to start, but there's no limit to the cool things you can do with it.

<span class="Willie">Willie</span> is available in the Fedora package
repositories, Arch User Repository, the
[Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/willie/), and in a
[tarball](http://willie.dftba.net/files/willie-4.0.0.tar.gz).

# Project History

Sean Palmer was the original creator of the bot, which he called phenny.

Michael Yanovich improved it, and changed the name to jenni.

Edward Powell improved it even more, with a lot of help from Dimitri Molenaars
and Elad Alfassa, and renamed it to Willie. This is the current and most
advanced version of the bot, which is supported by Nerdfighteria Network.

A number of other people have helped out along the way, and they can be seen in
the CREDITS file in Willie's source code.
