sopel-website
=============

Website for [Sopel](sopel-irc/sopel), deployed at http://sopel.chat

Made for use with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's not hosted on GitHub
pages, primarily so that we can have direct access to some other stuff under
the sopel.chat domain (meetbot logs, command docs at some point, etc.)
